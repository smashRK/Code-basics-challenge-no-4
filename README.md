# Code-basics-challenge-no-4

## Problem Statement

- Atliq Hardware is one of the leading computer hardware producers in India and has well-established operations in other countries too.

- The management noticed that they do not get enough insights to make quick and smart data-informed decisions. They want to expand their data analytics team by adding several junior data analysts. Tony Sharma, their data analytics director, wanted to hire someone who is good at both tech and soft skills. Hence, he decided to conduct a SQL challenge, which will help him understand both skills.

## Goal

### As an applicant for this role, the following tasks need to be performed:

1. The "ad-hoc-requests" have to be checked. There are 10 ad hoc requests for which the business needs insights.
2.  SQL queries need to be run to answer these requests.
